# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview

This project uses machine learning to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using a Decision Tree Classifier. The model is trained on the Titanic dataset, which includes various features of passengers to determine if they survived.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the Titanic dataset, which can be accessed [here](https://github.com/codebasics/py/raw/master/ML/9_decision_tree/Exercise/titanic.csv). It includes the following features:

- **Pclass**: Passenger class (1, 2, or 3)
- **Sex**: Gender (male or female)
- **Age**: Age in years
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings or spouses aboard
- **Parch**: Number of parents or children aboard
- **Fare**: Ticket fare
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
- **Survived**: Survival status (1 = survived, 0 = did not survive)
